## version 2.9.5 (April 11, 2017)

> This version somewhat break the compatibility with previous versions! To fix things, you will need to remove the call to the *show_debug_console* method as now the debugging console is automatically shown when script execution ends. If you were using the *write_log* method than you will need to remove the call to it and refer to the *debug* property for more information.

-  added support for [unbuffered queries](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqlinfo.concepts.buffering.php)
-  the debugging console is now automatically shown when script execution ends without the need to manually show it; as a consequence the *show_debug_console* and *halt* methods were removed
-  the [debug](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#var$debug) property can now be also an array (instead of just boolean) instructing the library to log debug information instead of showing it on the screen - as a consequence, the *write_log* method was removed
-  renamed the *console_show_records* to [debug_show_records](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#var$debug_show_records)
-  EXPLAIN and backtrace information can now be disabled from the debugging interface with the newly added [debug_show_explain](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#var$debug_show_explain) and [debug_backtrace](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#var$debug_show_backtrace) properties
-  added a new [option](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodoption) method for setting [connection options](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.options.php#refsect1-mysqli.options-parameters)
-  *database* argument is now optional in the [connect](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodconnect) method; additionally, an explicit selection of a database is not required anymore as now, in all the methods where required, you can prefix table names with database name, like *database.tablename*
-  the argument for the [free_result](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodfree_result) method is now optional and the last used resource will be used if not specified, just like for the rest of the methods requiring a result
-  fixed a bug where setting the *calc_rows* argument to *TRUE* for the [query](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodquery) method, and having a query starting with a comment would have no effect
-  fixed a bug with queries being always reported as being from cache in the log files written
-  backtrace information is not written to the log files by default anymore; in can be enabled by setting the [debug](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#var$debug) property to an array
-  query execution time is now shown in the debugging console in seconds rather than milliseconds
-  pressing *ESC* now closes the debugging console
-  changed the occurrences of PHP's [each()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.each.php) function which is being deprecated starting with PHP 7.2.0
-  **lots** of source code optimizations and documentation updates

## version 2.9.4 (April 01, 2017)

- fixed a bug where a new connection could not be made after using the [close](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodclose) method
- fixed an issue with the memcache warning message appearing even if no memcache extension was available; thanks **Jeff Buckles**
- the library now supports unbuffered queries using the newly added [query_unbuffered](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodquery_unbuffered) method
- added a new [select_database](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodselect_database) method (as a side-effect, the "database" argument is not mandatory anymore for the [connect](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database/Zebra_Database.html#methodconnect) method)
- added *DEFAULT* to the list of known MySQL functions; thanks **Jeff Buckles**

## version 2.9.3 (February 19, 2016)

- fixed an issue that would trigger a warning if a replacement value was an array instead of a string
- fixed a bug where "fetch_obj_all" method would fail if the "index" argument was given; thanks **Milan Kvita**

- fixed a bug where port and socket were not used even if set; thanks to **Nam Trung**
- fixed some typos in comments

## version 2.8.4 (December 22, 2013)

- added a new "memcache_key_prefix" property; this allows separate caching of the same queries by multiple instances of the libraries on the same memcache server, or the library handling multiple domains on the same memcache server; thanks to **primeinc**
- fixed a bug with the insert_bulk method; thanks to **Guillermo**

## version 2.8.3 (October 10, 2013)

- fixed a bug with the connection credentials which were stored in a public property rather than a private one; thanks **etb09**

- minor performance optimizations in the debug console's JavaScript code

## version 2.8.1 (August 02, 2013)

- fixed an issue introduced in the previous release generated by the changing of the arguments order in the "query" method and which affected some of the library's methods; thanks **ziggy**
- inversed the order of last 2 arguments of the "select" method ("calc_rows" now comes before "highlight"); if you were using this argument make sure to addapt your code; thanks **Prathamesh Gharat**
- fixed a bug where when setting a query to be highlighted the debugging console would actually open and show the respective query *only* if the library's "minimize_console" attribute was set to FALSE; now it will work either way
- the "connect" method has 2 new arguments: "port" and "socket"; because of this, the "connect" argument is now the last argument of the method so make sure you update your code if you have to; thanks **Corey**

## version 2.8 (March 15, 2013)

- dropped support for PHP 4; minimum required version is now PHP 5
- dropped support for PHP's *mysql* extension, which is [officially deprecated as of PHP v5.5.0](http://php.net/manual/en/changelog.mysql.php) and will be removed in the future; the extension was originally introduced in PHP v2.0 for MySQL v3.23, and no new features have been added since 2006; the library now relies on PHP's [mysqli](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) extension
- removed the "is_new" argument from the "connect" method as it's not needed by the mysqli extension; this means that "connect" is now the 5th argument and that this may break your code so be sure to update accordingly
- inversed the order of last 2 arguments of the "query" method ("calc_rows" now comes before "highlight"); <strong style="color: #c40000;">if you were using this argument make sure to addapt your code or risk opening a black-hole</strong>
- changed an instance of mktime() to time() as it was giving a "PHP Strict Standards" error since PHP 5.3.0
- fixed a bug when specifying custom paths for the "write_log" method ; thanks **Andrei Bodeanschi**
- fixed an issue where setting "cache_path" to a path without trailing slash would break the script
- fixed an issue where setting the caching time to 0 would still create (empty) cache files
- the JS and CSS files used by the debugger window are now loaded "protocol-less" in order to solve those mixed-content errors; thanks to **Mark Bjaergager**
- tweaked the CSS file a bit

## version 2.7.3 (July 16, 2012)

- the library now tries to write errors to the system log (if PHP is configured so; read more [here](http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.log-errors)) when the "debug" property is set to FALSE (as when the "debug" property is set to TRUE the error messages are reported in the debug console)
- the library will now show a warning message in the debug console if the "memcache" extension is loaded but it is not used
- cached data is now gzcompress-ed and base64_encoded which means cached data is a bit more secure and a bit more faster to load; thanks to **PunKeel** for suggesting this a while ago
- changed (again!) the order of the arguments for the "select" method - "limit" now comes before "order"; <em style="color: #c40000;">note that this update made the select() method backward incompatible and that you will have to change the order of the arguments for this to work!</em>
- added a small example on how to use caching through memcache; see the documentation for the "caching_method" property

## version 2.7.2 (April 07, 2012)

- fixed a bug that most likely appeared since 2.7, where the "seek" method (and any method relying on it, like all the "fetch" methods) would produce a warning in the debug console if there were no records in the sought resource
- fixed a bug where NULL could not be used in the "replacements" array of a query; thanks to **×× ×××ª ××ª×¨××**

## version 2.7.1 (February 10, 2012)

- the select() method took arguments in a different order than specified in the documentation; thanks to **Andrei Bodeanschi**; <em style="color: #c40000;">note that this update made the select() method backward incompatible and that you will have to change the order of the arguments for this to work!</em>
- fixed a bug where the update() and insert_update() methods were not working if in the array with the columns to update, the INC() keyword was used with a replacement marker instead of a value, and the actual value was given in the replacements array; thanks to **Andrei Bodeanschi**
- fixed a bug where the insert_update() method was not working when the only update field used the INC() keyword; the generated query contained an invalid comma between UPDATE and the field name; thanks to **Allan**

## version 2.7 (January 07, 2012)

- added support for caching query results using memcache. thanks to **Balazs** for suggesting it a while ago, and to **Ovidiu Mihalcea** for introducing me to memcache
- fixed a bug where the script would crash if the object was instantiated more than once and the *language* method was being called for each of the instances; thanks to **Edy Galantzan**
- completely rewritten the dlookup method which was not working correctly if anything else than a comma separated list of column names was used (like an expression, for example); thanks to **Allan**
- the "connect" method can now take an additional argument instructing it to connect to the database right away rather than using a "lazy" connection
- fixed a bug where some of the elements in the debug console were incorrectly inheriting the page's body color

## version 2.6 (September 03, 2011)

- changed the name of "get_columns" method to "get_table_columns" as it returned the number of columns in a given table, and added a new "get_columns" method which takes as argument a resource and returns the number of columns in the given resource
- some documentation clarifications

## version 2.5 (July 02, 2011)

- a new method is now available: "get_link" which returns the MySQL link identifier associated with the current connection to the MySQL server. Why as a separate method? Because the library uses "lazy connection" (it is not actually connecting to the database until first query is executed) there's no link identifier available when calling the *connect* method.
- a new argument is now available for the *insert* and *insert_bulk* methods which allows the creation of INSERT IGNORE queries which will skip records that would cause a duplicate entry for a primary key.
- the default value of the "debug" property was set to FALSE

## version 2.4 (June 20, 2011)

- fixed a bug with the *insert_bulk* method (thanks to **Edy Galantzan** for reporting)
- added a new method: *table_exists* which checks to see if a table with the name given as argument exists in the database
- the *select* method now also accepts *limit* and *order* arguments; due to this change, this method is not compatible with previous versions (thanks to **Monil** for suggesting this)
- some documentation refinements

## version 2.3 (April 15, 2011)

- fixed a bug where the script would generate a warning if the "update" method was called with invalid arguments
- changed how the *insert_bulk* method needs to receive arguments, making it more simple to use

## version 2.2 (March 05, 2011)

- fixed a bug where the "select" method war returning a boolean value rather than a resource (thanks to **Monil**)
- the class now uses "lazy connection" meaning that it will not actually connect to the database until the first query is run
- the debug console now shows also session variables
- the "show_debug_console" method can now be instructed to return output rather than print it to the screen
- the highlighter now highlights more keywords
- improved documentation for the "connect" method

## version 2.1 (January 27, 2011)

- fixed a bug where the console inherited CSS properties from the parent application
- fixed some bugs in the JavaScript file that would break the code when parent application was running MooTools
- transactions are now supported
- added a new "insert_bulk" method which allows inserting multiple values into a table using a single query (thanks **Sebi P.** for the suggestion)
- added a new "insert_update" method which will create INSERT statements with ON DUPLICATE UPDATE (thank **Sebi P.** for the suggestion)
- enhanced the "update" method
- the debug console now shows a warning if no charset and collation was specified
- corrections to the documentation

## version 2.0 (January 21, 2011)

- the entire code was improved and some of the properties as well as method names were changed and, therefore, this version breaks compatibility with earlier versions
- fixed a bug where the script would try to also cache action queries; thanks to **Romulo Gomez**
- fixed a bug in the "seek" method
- fixed a bug where on some configurations of Apache/PHP the script would not work
- fixed a bug where if there was a connection error or MySQL generated an error and the debug console was minimized, it would not be shown automatically
- fixed a bug where the "dlookup" method would not return escaped column names (i.e. `order`)
- fixed a bug where the "found_rows" property was incorrect for cached queries
- fixed a bug where the debug console would improperly manage columns enclosed in ` (backtick)
- fixed a bug that caused improper display of some strings in the debug console
- added a new method "select" - a shorthand for selecting queries
- added a new method "get_columns" - returns information about a given table's columns
- added a new method "implode" - similar to PHP's own implode() function, with the difference that this method "escapes" imploded elements and also encloses them in grave accents
- added a new method "set_charset" - sets the characters set and the collation of the database
- improved functionality of fetch_assoc_all() and fetch_obj_all() methods
- the debug console shows more information and in a much better and organized way
- rewritten the method for logging queries to a txt file making the output very easy to read
- dropped the XTemplate templating engine in order to improve speed; every aspect of the debug console can still be changed through the CSS file

## version 1.1.4 (July 24, 2008)

- fixed a bug in the update() method when calling the method without the replacements argument

## version 1.1.3 (June 02, 2008)

- fixed a bug that was causing an E_WARNING error when the caching folder could not be found
- fixed a minor issue that would trigger an error message if replacements were specified even though there was nothing to replace
- documentation is now clearer on how to define the caching folder

## version 1.1.2b (May 08, 2008)

- fixed a huge bug in the highlighter when using $replacements
- fixed an issue where when calling a function/method that executes a method of the class by using of call_user_func_array() and friends, will produce a warning message due to the fact that, in such cases, the information returned by debug_backtrace() function is incomplete
